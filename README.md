Template to bootstrap and configure new projects maintained by TwinStake

## Instructions

- Every project maintained by Twinstake should have a comprehensive and clear README file that serves as an index.
  - Follow the [Standard Readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/master/spec.md) specification.
  - Read [Art of README](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme).
  - The other sections of this file can be used as a template to bootstrap a new repository.

- Suggested options:
  - Enable _Issues_. Every task related to the project should be written as an issue. If the project is public, the issues should be a welcoming space to get feedback and bug reports from contributors.
  - Enable _Preserve this repository_.
  - Disable _Allow merge commits_.
  - Enable _Allow squash merging_. This makes commits clear and traceable to a pull request.
  - Disable _Allow rebase merging_.
  - Enable _Automatically delete head branches_.

- Suggested access:
  - Add at least two maintainers with the role _Admin_.
  - Add the _twinstake/engineering_ team with the role _Write_.

- Suggested branch protection for _main_:
  - Enable _Require a pull request before merging_.
  - Enable _Require approvals_ with 1 approval required.
  - Enable _Require status checks to pass before merging_.

- If the project is public, discuss and decide the appropriate license with the team.
